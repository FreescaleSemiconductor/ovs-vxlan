.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBovs\-vxctl\fR program is a command line tool to show VXLAN state tables
and to configure VXLAN peer's manually.
.

.SS "VXLAN MAC Table Commands"
.PP
.TP
\fBdump\-vme\fR
Prints MAC table to console. This table is a forwarding table of VXLAN. MAC
addresses are the end host mac address.
.TP
\fBdelete-vme\fB \fIvtep\fR=[vtep ip] \fIvni\fR=[tunnel id] \fImac\fR=[MAC address]
Delete a forwarding table MAC entry of a end host.

.SS "VXLAN PEER Table Commands"
.TP
\fBadd\-peer\fR \fIvni\fR=[tunnel id] \fIvtep\fR=[peer ip]
Add a peer.

.TP
\fBdel\-peer\fR \fIvni\fR=[tunnel id] \fIvtep\fR=[peer ip]
Delete a peer.
.TP
\fBdump\-peer\fR
Prints configured peers to console.

.PP
These commands configures VXLAN peers manually. Normally, VXLAN uses
multicast IP address to learn the end hosts dynamically. All of the peers(VTEPs)
also listens on a multicast IP address so that any one sending a 
packet to the multicast IP address will be received by all of the VTEPs.
When using multicast is not possible or undesirable, these
commands can be used to configure the overlay network manually. 

.PP
Let's say we have three VXLAN tunnel endpoints: TE1, TE2, TE3. 
TE1, TE2 and TE3 will terminate the VXLAN traffic and forward the inner Layer2 
packet on to their network. TE2 and TE3 are peers for TE1. TE1 and TE3
are peers for TE2. TE1 and TE2 are peers for TE3. All tunnel end points need to
be configured with their respective peers.

TE2 and TE3 are added as peers to TE1.

And same goes for TE2 and TE3.


.PP
Current implementation gives preference to multicast over manual
configuration. When vxlan interface is configured with multicast ip address,
manual peer configuration will not be used. A VXLAN network either uses
multicast or manual configuration but not both. These two are mutually exclusive.
